                <span class="spot-name">Welcome to Alber Park</span>
                <p class="spot-desc">
                    Albert Park is a large inner-city park located just south of Melbourne’s CBD, known for its
                    picturesque lake, wide green spaces, and iconic views of the city skyline. It’s a popular
                    recreational area featuring walking and cycling tracks, picnic areas, sports facilities, and the
                    renowned Albert Park Lake. The park also hosts the annual Australian Grand Prix, transforming into a
                    thrilling Formula 1 street circuit each March. Surrounded by palm trees and urban scenery, Albert
                    Park offers a tranquil escape within the city and is a favorite spot for families, joggers, and
                    tourists a like.

                <span class="spot-name">Fishing at Alber Park Lake</span>
                <p class="spot-desc">
                    The lake is regularly stocked with native species like golden perch and Rainbow trout, and also
                    contains European carp, which are common targets. Fishing is permitted from the banks, and the still
                    waters make it ideal for beginners and casual fishers. Anglers typically use corn, worms, or soft
                    plastics as bait. A valid Victorian recreational fishing licence is required, and while the lake is
                    not known for trophy-sized catches, it provides a convenient and scenic fishing location close to
                    the heart of Melbourne.It’s worth noting that this lake has a depth of only 1 to 2 meters, and the
                    shoreline is densely covered with aquatic vegetation. As a result, anglers need a considerable level
                    of skill and experience to achieve satisfying catches here.
                    <br>
                    The fish species commonly found in Aleber park lake include:
                    <br>
                    Redfin Perch: A popular target species, especially in the cooler months. They respond well to soft
                    plastics and small spinners.

                <p class="spot-desc">
                    Rainbow Trout: Occasionally found in cooler stretches, especially closer to tributaries like the
                    Plenty River.
                </p>

                <p class="spot-desc">
                    Murray Cod: Murray Cod is Australia’s largest native freshwater fish and a highly sought-after
                    target among anglers. Found in parts of the Murray-Darling Basin, including some upper sections of
                    the Yarra River and its tributaries, Murray Cod prefer deep holes, submerged logs, and rocky
                    structures. They can be caught using large hardbody lures, spinnerbaits, soft plastics, or live
                    baits like yabbies and big worms. Heavy tackle is essential,Early mornings, late afternoons, and
                    summer nights are the most productive times. Anglers must observe strict regulations, including a
                    closed season from September to early December, minimum size limits, and daily catch limits. Catch
                    and release is widely practiced to ensure the sustainability of the species.In 2021, the Victorian
                    government released a large number of Murray cod into this lake. However, to this day, no one has
                    been seen catching any of them.

                <p class="spot-desc">
                    Estuary Perch:The Estuary Perch (Macquaria colonorum) is a native Australian fish species found
                    primarily in coastal rivers, estuaries, and brackish waters of southeastern Australia. Closely
                    related to the Australian bass, it is known for its strong fighting ability and is highly prized by
                    sport anglers. Estuary perch typically inhabit structures such as submerged timber, rock ledges, and
                    deep holes, especially during the cooler months when they move upstream to spawn. They respond well
                    to soft plastics, hardbody lures, and live bait, and are most active during dawn, dusk, and overcast
                    conditions. Sustainable fishing practices are encouraged to protect their limited and vulnerable
                    habitat.

                <p class="spot-desc">
                    Golden Perch:also known as "yellowbelly," is a popular native freshwater sportfish found in Australia’s inland rivers and reservoirs. Known for its powerful fight, it prefers warm, slow-moving waters with structures like submerged logs. Golden perch readily take lures and live bait, especially during warmer months, and are commonly targeted in places like the Murray River and stocked lakes across Victoria.The best way to catch them is by using soft plastics that mimic their natural prey, such as small baitfish, or by using crankbaits and spoons that imitate slightly larger fish invading their territory.

                <p class="spot-desc">
                    Common Carp: Although introduced and considered a pest, they are abundant and put up a strong fight, making them appealing to some recreational fishers.Victoria has strict regulations regarding carp fishing. Due to the severe environmental damage carp cause to local waterways, all carp caught must not be returned to the water.Carp are omnivorous fish and can be caught with almost any type of bait. Naturally, non-artificial baits tend to be significantly more effective than lures. This principle generally applies across all types of waterways.
                </p>

                <p class="spot-desc">
                    Fishing in this area is more about enjoying the serenity of the bushland and spotting wildlife than sheer volume of catches. Best results often come during early morning or late afternoon, particularly in spring and autumn. Local regulations require a Victorian Recreational Fishing Licence, and catch limits must be followed.
