                <p class="spot-desc">
                    Caulfield Racecourse Lake is a small artificial lake situated within the grounds of Caulfield Racecourse in Melbourne's southeastern suburb of Caulfield East. Managed by the Victoria Amateur Turf Club, the lake is accessible to the public from 9 am to 5 pm, except on race days, with entry via Gate 22 on Station Street or Gate 9 on Kambrook Road. Its central location and proximity to Caulfield Station make it a convenient spot for local recreation.

                <span class="spot-name">Fishing at Caulfield Racecourse</span>
                <p class="spot-desc">
                    The lake is regularly stocked with native species like golden perch and Rainbow trout, and also
                    contains European carp, which are common targets. Fishing is permitted from the banks, and the still
                    waters make it ideal for beginners and casual fishers. Anglers typically use corn, worms, or soft
                    plastics as bait. A valid Victorian recreational fishing licence is required, and while the lake is
                    not known for trophy-sized catches, it provides a convenient and scenic fishing location close to
                    the heart of Melbourne.It’s worth noting that this lake has a depth of only 1 to 2 meters, and the
                    shoreline is densely covered with aquatic vegetation. As a result, anglers need a considerable level
                    of skill and experience to achieve satisfying catches here.

                    The fish species commonly found in Aleber park lake include:
                    <br>
                    Redfin Perch: A popular target species, especially in the cooler months. They respond well to soft
                    plastics and small spinners.

                <p class="spot-desc">
                    Rainbow Trout: Occasionally found in cooler stretches, especially closer to tributaries like the Plenty River.This is a very small and shallow lake, and after a new round of trout stocking by the government, it can be quite challenging to catch them. All types of bait are worth trying—whether it's soft plastics, spoons, creek spinners, or PowerBait.

                <p class="spot-desc">
                    Common Carp: Although introduced and considered a pest, they are abundant and put up a strong fight, making them appealing to some recreational fishers.Victoria has strict regulations regarding carp fishing. Due to the severe environmental damage carp cause to local waterways, all carp caught must not be returned to the water.Carp are omnivorous fish and can be caught with almost any type of bait. Naturally, non-artificial baits tend to be significantly more effective than lures. This principle generally applies across all types of waterways.

                <p class="spot-desc">
                    Murray Cod: Murray Cod is Australia’s largest native freshwater fish and a highly sought-after target among anglers. Found in parts of the Murray-Darling Basin, including some upper sections of the Yarra River and its tributaries, Murray Cod prefer deep holes, submerged logs, and rocky structures. They can be caught using large hardbody lures, spinnerbaits, soft plastics, or live baits like yabbies and big worms. Heavy tackle is essential,Early mornings, late afternoons, and summer nights are the most productive times. Anglers must observe strict regulations, including a closed season from September to early December, minimum size limits, and daily catch limits. Catch and release is widely practiced to ensure the sustainability of the species.In recent years, the Victorian government has stocked several dozen Murray cods in this area, and lately, there have been occasional reports of successful catches. When it comes to choosing lures, just remember—bigger is better.

                  <p class="spot-desc">
                    Fishing in this area is more about enjoying the serenity of the bushland and spotting wildlife than sheer volume of catches. Best results often come during early morning or late afternoon, particularly in spring and autumn. Local regulations require a Victorian Recreational Fishing Licence, and catch limits must be followed.
