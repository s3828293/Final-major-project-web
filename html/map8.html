                <p class="spot-desc">
                    Devilbend Reservoir is the largest inland body of water on the Mornington Peninsula, located within
                    the Devilbend Natural Features Reserve in Tuerong, approximately 55 km southeast of Melbourne.
                    Spanning over 250 hectares, the reservoir is surrounded by lowland forests and grassy woodlands,
                    offering a haven for waterbirds and wildlife. Visitors can enjoy a range of recreational activities,
                    including walking and cycling along scenic trails, picnicking at Daangean Point, birdwatching, and
                    non-powered watercraft activities in designated zones. The reserve is recognized for its ecological
                    significance, supporting diverse flora and fauna, including the threatened Blue-billed Duck and the
                    majestic White-bellied Sea Eagle.

                <span class="spot-name">Fishing at Devilbend Reservoir</span>
                <p class="spot-desc">
                    Fishing at Devilbend Reservoir is permitted in designated areas and caters to anglers of all skill
                    levels. The reservoir has been regularly stocked with over 250,000 trout since 2010, with some fish
                    reaching up to 2 kg. Additionally, more than 120,000 estuary perch have been introduced, providing
                    excellent opportunities for lure and fly fishing enthusiasts. Anglers can fish from the shoreline,
                    newly established fishing platforms, or non-powered watercraft within a 33-hectare designated zone.
                    A valid Victorian recreational fishing licence is required, and all local fishing regulations,
                    including size and bag limits, must be observed.

                    The fish species commonly found in Devilbend reservoir include:
                    <br>
                    Redfin Perch: A popular target species, especially in the cooler months. They respond well to soft
                    plastics and small spinners.

                <p class="spot-desc">

                    Rainbow Trout: Occasionally found in cooler stretches, especially closer to tributaries like the
                    Plenty River.Creek spinner and spoon are incredible for them here.
                </p>

                <p class="spot-desc">
                    Estuary Perch:The Estuary Perch (Macquaria colonorum) is a native Australian fish species found
                    primarily in coastal rivers, estuaries, and brackish waters of southeastern Australia. Closely
                    related to the Australian bass, it is known for its strong fighting ability and is highly prized by
                    sport anglers. Estuary perch typically inhabit structures such as submerged timber, rock ledges, and
                    deep holes, especially during the cooler months when they move upstream to spawn. They respond well
                    to soft plastics, hardbody lures, and live bait, and are most active during dawn, dusk, and overcast
                    conditions. Sustainable fishing practices are encouraged to protect their limited and vulnerable
                    habitat.

                <p class="spot-desc">
                    Common Carp: Although introduced and considered a pest, they are abundant and put up a strong fight,
                    making them appealing to some recreational fishers.Victoria has strict regulations regarding carp
                    fishing. Due to the severe environmental damage carp cause to local waterways, all carp caught must
                    not be returned to the water.Carp are omnivorous fish and can be caught with almost any type of
                    bait. Naturally, non-artificial baits tend to be significantly more effective than lures. This
                    principle generally applies across all types of waterways.

                <p class="spot-desc">
                    Fishing in this area is more about enjoying the serenity of the bushland and spotting wildlife than
                    sheer volume of catches. Best results often come during early morning or late afternoon,
                    particularly in spring and autumn. Local regulations require a Victorian Recreational Fishing
                    Licence, and catch limits must be followed.
