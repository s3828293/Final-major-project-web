                <p class="spot-desc">
                    Yarrambat Casting Pool is a purpose-built fly casting facility located within Yarrambat Park in
                    Melbourne's northern suburbs. Managed by the Northern Suburbs Fly Fishing Club, the pool meets
                    competition standards and is situated just 50 meters from the clubrooms, which include amenities
                    like toilets and a kitchen. A floodlight has been installed to allow for nighttime practice
                    sessions, and the club regularly hosts 'Come and Try' days to introduce newcomers to fly fishing.

                <p class="spot-desc">
                    Adjacent to the casting pool, Yarrambat Park Lake offers a tranquil setting for recreational
                    fishing. The lake is regularly stocked with rainbow trout, especially during school holidays, and
                    also contains species like redfin and carp. Anglers can fish from the shoreline using baits such as
                    worms, yabbies, or soft plastics. A valid Victorian recreational fishing licence is required, and
                    all local fishing regulations, including size and bag limits, must be observed.
                    <br>

                    The fish species commonly found in Yarrambat casting pool include:
                    <br>

                    Redfin Perch: A popular target species, especially in the cooler months. They respond well to soft
                    plastics and small spinners.This fishing spot is specifically designed for fly fishing, and using
                    hand-tied fly hooks can often yield surprisingly effective results.

                <p class="spot-desc">
                    Rainbow Trout: Occasionally found in cooler stretches, especially closer to tributaries like the
                    Plenty River.This fishing spot is specifically designed for fly fishing, and using hand-tied fly
                    hooks can often yield surprisingly effective results.

                <p class="spot-desc">
                    Common Carp: Although introduced and considered a pest, they are abundant and put up a strong fight,
                    making them appealing to some recreational fishers.Victoria has strict regulations regarding carp
                    fishing. Due to the severe environmental damage carp cause to local waterways, all carp caught must
                    not be returned to the water.Carp are omnivorous fish and can be caught with almost any type of
                    bait. Naturally, non-artificial baits tend to be significantly more effective than lures. This
                    principle generally applies across all types of waterways.

                <p class="spot-desc">
                    Fishing in this area is more about enjoying the serenity of the bushland and spotting wildlife than
                    sheer volume of catches. Best results often come during early morning or late afternoon,
                    particularly in spring and autumn. Local regulations require a Victorian Recreational Fishing
                    Licence, and catch limits must be followed. </p>
