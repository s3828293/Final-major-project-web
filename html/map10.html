                    <p class="spot-desc">
                        Ferntree Gully Quarry Reserve is a scenic park located in Melbourne's eastern suburb of Ferntree
                        Gully. Once an active bluestone quarry, the site has been transformed into a tranquil urban
                        oasis featuring a serene lake surrounded by native vegetation and dramatic cliff faces. The
                        reserve offers amenities such as walking trails, picnic areas, playgrounds, and fishing
                        platforms, making it a popular spot for families, walkers, and nature enthusiasts. Its unique
                        landscape and peaceful environment provide a perfect escape from the city's hustle and bustle.

                    <p class="spot-desc">
                        Fishing at Ferntree Gully Quarry Reserve is permitted and caters to anglers of all skill levels.
                        The lake is regularly stocked with rainbow trout, especially during school holidays, as part of
                        the Victorian Government's Go Fishing Victoria initiative. Other species commonly found in the
                        lake include redfin, carp, golden perch, Australian bass and Murray cod. Anglers can fish from
                        the shoreline or designated fishing platforms, using baits such as worms, corn, and soft
                        plastics. A valid Victorian recreational fishing licence is required, and all local fishing
                        regulations, including size and bag limits, must be observed. It’s worth noting that the water
                        here reaches depths of up to 11 meters, allowing anglers to use specialized baits to target
                        specific fish species.

                        <br>
                        The fish species commonly found in Ferntree gully quarry include:
                        <br>
                        Redfin Perch: A popular target species, especially in the cooler months. Lighter soft plastics,
                        spoons, or stream spinners are more recommended here.
                    </p>

                    <p class="spot-desc">

                        Rainbow Trout: Occasionally found in cooler stretches, especially closer to tributaries like the
                        Plenty River.Lighter soft plastics, spoons, or stream spinners are more recommended here.
                    </p>

                    <p class="spot-desc">
                        Murray Cod: Murray Cod is Australia’s largest native freshwater fish and a highly sought-after
                        target among anglers. Found in parts of the Murray-Darling Basin, including some upper sections
                        of the Yarra River and its tributaries, Murray Cod prefer deep holes, submerged logs, and rocky
                        structures. They can be caught using large hardbody lures, spinnerbaits, soft plastics, or live
                        baits like yabbies and big worms. Heavy tackle is essential,Early mornings, late afternoons, and
                        summer nights are the most productive times. Anglers must observe strict regulations, including
                        a closed season from September to early December, minimum size limits, and daily catch limits.
                        Catch and release is widely practiced to ensure the sustainability of the species.

                    <p class="spot-desc">

                        Australian Bass: Australian Bass is a native freshwater and estuarine fish found along the
                        eastern coast of Australia. Known for its strong fight and seasonal migration, it inhabits
                        rivers, creeks, and estuaries. Australian Bass are popular among sport fishers and respond well
                        to lures, flies, and live bait, especially during warm months and low-light conditions.This spot
                        is one of the few places in the Melbourne area where you can catch Australian Bass. However, the
                        bass here tend to be small in size, and catching them requires a lot of patience. Soft plastics
                        and spoons are highly recommended for targeting them effectively.

                    <p class="spot-desc">

                        Common Carp: Although introduced and considered a pest, they are abundant and put up a strong
                        fight, making them appealing to some recreational fishers.Victoria has strict regulations
                        regarding carp fishing. Due to the severe environmental damage carp cause to local waterways,
                        all carp caught must not be returned to the water.Carp are omnivorous fish and can be caught
                        with almost any type of bait. Naturally, non-artificial baits tend to be significantly more
                        effective than lures. This principle generally applies across all types of waterways.

                        Fishing in this area is more about enjoying the serenity of the bushland and spotting wildlife
                        than sheer volume of catches. Best results often come during early morning or late afternoon,
                        particularly in spring and autumn. Local regulations require a Victorian Recreational Fishing
                        Licence, and catch limits must be followed. </p>
