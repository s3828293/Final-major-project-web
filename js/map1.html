                <p class="spot-desc">
                    The Yarra River is one of Melbourne’s most iconic waterways, and its character becomes especially rich and diverse outside the CBD. Flowing from the eastern suburbs of Warrandyte to its mouth at Port Phillip Bay, the river traverses a variety of landscapes and communities. In the upper reaches around Warrandyte and Templestowe, the river winds through largely unspoiled natural environments, with dense bushland and wildlife, making it ideal for hiking, mountain biking, and kayaking. As the river moves into mid-suburban areas such as Heidelberg and Bulleen, it becomes a cultural corridor, home to sites like the Heide Museum of Modern Art, where art and nature coexist harmoniously. The continuous Yarra Trail runs along much of the river, offering scenic routes for running and cycling. Further downstream, through areas like Toorak and Burnley, the river broadens and is flanked by gardens, wetlands, and remnants of Melbourne’s industrial past, creating a unique contrast between urban life and natural beauty. Overall, the Yarra River in non-CBD areas serves not only as a vital ecological corridor but also as a space where leisure, culture, and history intersect across the suburban landscape.

                <span class="spot-name">Fishing at Yarra river</span>
                <p class="spot-desc">Welcome to the Yarra River Fishing Guide. Before we begin, an important note: the Yarra River runs through Melbourne and stretches for 242 kilometers. However, there is a significant difference in the environment and fish species between its estuary and inland freshwater areas. This guide focuses exclusively on the freshwater section.In the upper reaches of the Yarra River—particularly around areas like Warrandyte, Templestowe, and Eltham—the fishing environment is more natural and tranquil, offering a scenic and peaceful setting for anglers. This part of the river is narrower, with slower-moving water, shaded banks, and abundant native vegetation, making it suitable for both shore-based and light watercraft fishing such as kayaks or canoes.
                   <br> The fish species commonly found in the upper Yarra include:
                   <br>
                    Redfin Perch: A popular target species, especially in the cooler months. They like responding well to soft plastics and small spinners in this water
                </p>
                <img class="main-img" src="../images/3.jpg" alt="Fishing Spot" />
                <p class="spot-desc">
                    Murray Cod: Murray Cod is Australia’s largest native freshwater fish and a highly sought-after target among anglers. Found in parts of the Murray-Darling Basin, including some upper sections of the Yarra River and its tributaries, Murray Cod prefer deep holes, submerged logs, and rocky structures. They can be caught using large hardbody lures, spinnerbaits, soft plastics, or live baits like yabbies and big worms. Heavy tackle is essential,Early mornings, late afternoons, and summer nights are the most productive times. Anglers must observe strict regulations, including a closed season from September to early December, minimum size limits, and daily catch limits. Catch and release is widely practiced to ensure the sustainability of the species.

                <p class="spot-desc">Common Carp: Although introduced and considered a pest, they are abundant and put up a strong fight, making them appealing to some recreational fishers.Victoria has strict regulations regarding carp fishing. Due to the severe environmental damage carp cause to local waterways, all carp caught must not be returned to the water.Carp are omnivorous fish and can be caught with almost any type of bait. Naturally, non-artificial baits tend to be significantly more effective than lures. This principle generally applies across all types of waterways.

                </p>

                <p class="spot-desc">
                    Rainbow Trout: Occasionally found in cooler stretches, especially closer to tributaries like the Plenty River.Due to the fast current of the Yarra River, spoons are the most recommended type of lure to use.
                </p>
                <img class="main-img" src="../images/6.jpg" alt="Fishing Spot" />
                <p class="spot-desc">Fishing in this area is more about enjoying the serenity of the bushland and spotting wildlife than sheer volume of catches. Best results often come during early morning or late afternoon, particularly in spring and autumn. Local regulations require a Victorian Recreational Fishing Licence, and catch limits must be followed.
